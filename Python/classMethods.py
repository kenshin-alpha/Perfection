# A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
# They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points 
# to the class and not the object instance.
# It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of 
# the class. For example, it can modify a class variable that will be 
# applicable to all the instances.

# The difference between the Class method and the static method is:

# A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
# A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
